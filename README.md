# Decentralized Flood Insurance Platform

A blockchain-based parametric insurance solution that provides transparent, automated flood coverage with real-time monitoring and incentivized risk reduction.

## Overview

This platform leverages blockchain technology, IoT sensors, and smart contracts to revolutionize flood insurance by creating a transparent, efficient, and fair system for all stakeholders. By automating risk assessment, monitoring, claims processing, and mitigation incentives, we reduce costs, eliminate disputes, and encourage proactive flood prevention.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Risk Assessment Contract

Calculates insurance premiums through algorithmic risk evaluation:

- Location-based risk scoring using elevation data and flood plains
- Historical flood data analysis and pattern recognition
- Property characteristics assessment (construction, elevation, etc.)
- Climate model integration for future risk projections
- Dynamic pricing adjustments based on changing conditions
- Premium calculation with transparent methodology

### 2. Water Level Monitoring Contract

Creates a trusted oracle network for real-time flood data:

- Integration with IoT sensor networks for river levels
- Weather station data collection for rainfall measurements
- Satellite imagery analysis for flood extent verification
- Consensus mechanisms for data validation
- Tamper-proof recording of environmental measurements
- Historical data archiving for trend analysis

### 3. Automated Claim Processing Contract

Enables parametric insurance with instant, dispute-free claims:

- Predefined trigger conditions based on water levels
- Tiered payout structure based on flood severity
- Automated verification of flood event parameters
- Instant fund distribution when conditions are met
- Multi-signature security for large payouts
- Audit trail of all claim events and payments

### 4. Mitigation Incentive Contract

Rewards proactive risk reduction through verified improvements:

- Property improvement verification system
- Discount calculation for implemented protections
- Community-level incentives for collaborative projects
- Educational resource access tracking
- Long-term risk reduction measurement
- Reward distribution for sustained mitigation efforts

- **Oracle System:** Chainlink integration for external data verification
- **Data Storage:** IPFS for property documentation and historical data
- **Frontend:** React-based dashboard with mapping integration
- **Sensor Integration:** IoT middleware with cryptographic verification
- **Analytics Engine:** Machine learning models for risk assessment and fraud detection

## Risk Management

- Diversified risk pools across geographic regions
- Reinsurance integration through nested smart contracts
- Reserve requirements enforced by contract logic
- Gradual rollout to limit early platform risk
- Circuit breakers for extreme catastrophic events
- Regular third-party actuarial audits

## Development Roadmap
